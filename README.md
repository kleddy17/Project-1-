Game Title : Salem Trail

Demo Link: 

Concept: 
A trivia game of Salem, Massachusetts facts! Get the high score and become
a powerful witch.

Approach: 
1. I first wireframed the idea on a mockup, with notes and basic logic. 

2.  My first approach was to use radio buttons to display the questions and answers on each page. 

3. After some more research, I went with using innerHTML to display the questions and answers with an UL and LI. 

4. Figured out how to use the textfield and gather data from it. 

My approach for this game was to have questions and answers pop up after you click the next button. To get 
the answers, I made a textfield box, along with a submit button.
