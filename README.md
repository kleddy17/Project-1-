Game Title : Salem Trail


Concept: 
A trivia game of Salem, Massachusetts facts! Get the high score and become
a powerful witch.

Approach: 
1.  Wireframed the idea on a mockup, with notes and basic logic. 

2.  My first approach was to use radio buttons to display the questions and answers on each page. 

3. After some more research, I went with using innerHTML to display the questions and answers with an UL and LI. 

4. Figured out how to use the textfield and gather data from it.
